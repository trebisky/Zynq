The RSA stuff is supplied by librsa.a

We do this:

ar t librsa.a
    SoftRSA.o
    SoftSHA256.o

Neither SoftRSA.c or SoftSHA256.c are on my system anywhere.
It would seem that these are supplied in binary form as part of
the zynq_fsbl distribution.  We don't use them, so it is just
curiosity to look for them.
