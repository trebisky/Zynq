Zynq projects

For some time I have been working with various Zynq-7000 based boards.
I have projects specific to these on Github.
Recently I began doing things that were no board specific, and it
made sense to set up a board agnostic project (namely this right here).

The projects here are:

1. bootrom - extraction and disassembly of the Zynq bootrom
2. fsbl - the Xilinx fsbl code rearranged
3. secret - the "secret" uart loader in the bootrom

Also see my board specific Zynq projects:
